# Advanced ML Pipeline

## Overview
The Advanced ML Pipeline project is designed to facilitate the deployment, monitoring, and management of machine learning models in production environments.

## Features
- **Model Training**: Streamlined process for training machine learning models using various algorithms.
- **Data Processing**: Efficient data handling techniques to clean, transform, and prepare datasets.
- **Model Deployment**: Tools for deploying models as APIs for easy access and integration.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of model performance with alerts on metric deviations.
- **Version Control**: Stay organized with versioning for both datasets and models.

## Installation
